# SQL_Netflix-project
For this project, I created a Netflix recommendation system using MySQL. I designed a database to store information about the Show Id, Director, Cast, Movie rating, Release date and Movie location. Using SQL queries, I generated movie and show recommendations based on user preferences, movie rating and duration and similarity between movies.
